# Part 1: Object Models
# Create a lib directory and put the classes you create in there.
# Create a Class for song, artist, and genre. Use an individual file for each class.
# These files should be placed within a lib directory and required on the top of
# any script that utilizes them (including this test script). Once required
# all the tests within this suite should pass.
# Before you start trying to make tests pass, think through artists, songs and genres are related in the real world.
# Our goal is to model the real world using classes and relationships between objects.  Any relationship you
# create should intuitively make sense to you.
